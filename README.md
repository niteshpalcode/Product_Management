# Product-Management-System
This is a small eCommerce project aimed at building an online platform for users to buy and sell products. The platform is designed to cater to the needs of both customers and admin users. Customers can search for products, view product details, add products to their cart, make purchases, and track their orders. Admin users, on the other hand, can manage products, orders, and users.

The project includes several user side features such as a landing , search functionality, product sorting and filtering, add to cart, checkout, and order tracking. The admin side features include product management, order management, user management, and dashboard to monitor sales and performance.
